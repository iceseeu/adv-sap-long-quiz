## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture

1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).

- Service Oriented Architecture, or SOA, is an approach we take when organizing a software system. We think of it as assembling a system from various service components, each like a flexible and reusable building block. Each of these services is a fundamental unit with its own business relevance, and we connect them together to shape the overall system. In our SOA approach, we design each service to have minimal dependency on others. This allows for their independent implementation, free from the constraints of any specific platform. Crucially, in SOA, we always emphasize the need for standardized interfaces for these services. Itâ€™s important for us because it ensures that the services are compatible and can work together seamlessly within the architecture.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

- Standardized Service Contracts: In SOA, the services within a service inventory adhere to standardized contract design guidelines. This ensures uniformity and consistency across all services.
- Loose Coupling: The services in SOA maintain minimal dependencies on each other. This means that each service can operate independently, without being tightly bound to the consumer or the specific details of other services.
- Abstraction: In SOA, services present only essential information in their contracts. The scope of information available about each service is carefully outlined, keeping unnecessary details hidden.
- Reusability: Services in SOA are designed with agnostic logic, which allows them to be reused across different parts of the business. This is akin to having modular components that can be utilized in various contexts.
- Autonomy: Each service in SOA has a high degree of control over its own execution environment. This autonomy allows services to be managed and operated independently.
- Statelessness: SOA services are designed to minimize resource usage by managing state data only when necessary. This approach helps in efficient resource management.
- Discoverability: Services in SOA are accompanied by descriptive metadata, which makes it easier to locate and understand them. This feature aids in effectively finding and utilizing services.
- Composability: Services in SOA are adept at being part of larger compositions, regardless of the size and complexity. They can be combined and recombined to create various business processes and functionalities.

3. Define Microservices.

- In software development, microservices represent a dual approach, both architectural and organizational, where software is built using small, independent services that interact through clearly specified APIs. Each service is managed by a dedicated, compact team. Adopting a microservices architecture brings several advantages, including improved scalability and quicker development cycles. This approach nurtures innovation and accelerates the process of bringing new features to the marketplace.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

- Enhanced Productivity: Breaking down an application into smaller, independent segments simplifies both its construction and maintenance.
- Greater Scalability: Distributing services across multiple servers helps mitigate the impact of high-demand components on overall performance.
- Improved Resilience: This approach facilitates quicker identification and resolution of performance issues at their root.
- Business Functionality Optimization: Existing services can be adapted for use in different scenarios, eliminating the need to develop new modules from the ground up.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

- Similarities between SOA and Microservices:
- Flexible Technology Use: Both SOA and microservices are open to using different kinds of technology. SOA works with many technologies as long as they meet certain rules. Microservices also allow using different tech for each service, which makes them very adaptable.
- Focus on Reusable and Independent Services: SOA is about using services again in different places, while microservices highlight small, stand-alone services. Both approaches share this idea of using smaller parts that can be easily managed, making it easier to build and change software systems.
- Differences between SOA and Microservices:
- How Services are Used: SOA uses services like building blocks to create business programs. Each service in SOA does a specific business job and can work with different kinds of computer languages and systems. This lets services be used again and mixed together for big tasks.
- Size and Purpose of Services: Microservices are like an updated version of SOA, but they use tinier, more focused parts for each job. SOA has services that cover a lot of business functions, but microservices break these down into smaller pieces. This makes microservices better for use with newer cloud-based business systems, and they are more about doing one thing really well compared to SOA's broader approach.

6. Define Web Services.

- A web service is a type of service available on the internet, typically used by electronic devices like computers or smartphones. It's a way for software applications to offer functions or data to other devices. These services can be accessed through standard computer software or mobile applications. Web services can be either open to everyone or specifically designed for business purposes. They have a wide range of uses, including but not limited to selling products or services.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.

- Exposing the Existing Function on the Network: This is like sharing a useful tool or ability online so that others can access and use it easily over the internet. It's about making something valuable available to a wider audience digitally.
- Interoperability: This involves ensuring different devices or systems can communicate with each other smoothly, even if they're different types. It's about creating a way for various technologies to work together seamlessly.
- Standardized Protocol: This is akin to having a common set of rules or guidelines for communication that everyone follows. It helps in making interactions clear and efficient, as everyone understands and uses the same system.
- Low Cost Communication: This refers to finding an affordable way to facilitate communication between different entities. It's about sending messages or sharing data without incurring high costs, making communication more accessible and economical.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.

- XML-Based: This works like a universal language that computers use to talk to each other, making sure they understand each other's messages clearly.
- Loosely Coupled: This is like having devices or systems work together but with more independence from each other, allowing for more flexibility.
- Coarse-Grained: This approach is about combining bigger tasks into larger groups. It makes communication more efficient because it reduces the need to send lots of small messages back and forth.
- Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous: This is like choosing between having a live, real-time conversation (synchronous) or leaving a message for someone to respond to later (asynchronous).
- Supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs): This is like giving a computer a specific, small task to do for you, similar to delegating a job to someone remotely.
- Supports Document Exchange: This is akin to computers swapping documents filled with information, which helps in understanding and working with the data more easily.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.

- Provider: This is like someone who offers a product or service. In a restaurant scenario, it's similar to a chef who prepares and serves dishes.
- Requestor: This works like someone asking for help or making an order. It's akin to a customer choosing items from a menu in a restaurant.
- Broker: This role acts as a go-between for requestors and providers, much like a waiter in a restaurant who takes orders from customers and conveys them to the kitchen.
- Publish: This is about making service information available, similar to how a restaurant might display its menu items for customers to see.
- Find: This is like looking for a specific item on a menu or searching for a particular service that meets your needs.
- Bind: This is comparable to placing an order with a waiter. It's about establishing a connection or starting a transaction between the requestor and the provider.

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.

- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): SOAP is like a rulebook for how web services should communicate with each other. It simplifies the way applications talk to each other by structuring messages in a specific format using XML. This makes it easier for different software to interact and share information.
- WSDL (Web Services Description Language): WSDL is a language, based on XML, that describes what a web service can do. It's like a guide that outlines the services' capabilities, where they send and receive data, and how they communicate. It essentially details the functions and operations that a web service offers, making it clear for others to understand and use.
- UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration): UDDI uses a standard approach to help businesses easily share, find, and connect to web services. It simplifies the process of locating and integrating web services into networked systems. Think of it as a directory or listing that makes it easier to find and use web services within a network.
